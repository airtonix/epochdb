    <p>
      So I was out there on Green Mountain one day, about to start the whole creative process of
      base-building. I needed some reference matieral to remind myself what was required to build
      all the various parts (because why memorise something when you can look it up right?).
    </p>
    <p>
      However one this day. dayzepoch.com was down for backup.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      So I said, "that's it" and started gathering as much data as I could find.
      
    </p>
    <h4 id="the-plan" data-toc="data-toc">The Plan</h4>
    <p>I had this plan :
      <ul>
        <li>Host the site from github pages (becuase I love git)</li>
        <li>Use AngularJS as the clientside framework, avoid Jquery</li>
        <li>
          Because github only allows static websites, and angular doesn't have a yaml consumer yet,
          I'd have to store all the data as JSON. No problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          Develop the application locally using Wintersmith, a static website generator that consumes
          folder tree of markdown/json/yaml files and lets you use what ever templating language you 
          want (I went with Jade, because I like the time saving data structure of yaml)
        </li>
        <li>
          I would use Sass and Foundation. But because I was staying as far away from Ruby as I could
          manage (wintersmith is a nodejs tool), I would use Bourbon instead of Compass.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'd make use of Grunt, Npm and Bower because manually finding and downloading stuff is such a
          boring task.
        </li>
        <li>Finally, my deployment strategy is a `git add --all && git commit -am "changelog message" && git push`</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h4 id="roadmap" data-toc="data-toc">Roadmap?</h4>
    <p>Yes, I have an idea for where I want to take this. I'll publish it here soon.</p>
    <h4 id="difficulties" data-toc="data-toc">Difficulties</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Contributing will be different. You'll need a Github account (which is free)</li>
      <li>
        No server side logic, which is a blessing in disguise. All the critical features requiring server side 
        tools are already provided by Github.
        
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="contributing" data-toc="data-toc">Contributing</h4>
    <p>If you want to contribute then there are two ways, both require at least a Github account. </p>
    <p>All contritbutions will be credited :)</p>
    <h5 id="non-technical" data-toc-parent="data-toc-parent">Non-Technical</h5>
    <p>
      Once you have your github account, you can just head over the issues page and make a ticket 
      describing your contribution.
      
    </p>
    <h5 id="technical" data-toc-parent="data-toc-parent">Technical</h5>
    <p>If you're familiar with how github works, then feel free to fork, edit and make a pull request.</p>
